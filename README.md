# Screen-Time Analysis of Game Of Thrones Characters

## Datasets
Datasets were created using the screen time recorded by an [IMDB user](www.imdb.com/list/ls076752033/).

There are two datasets:
1. Top 100 characters in terms of screen time. 
2. Screen time of 9 most important houses shown in Game Of Thrones.
